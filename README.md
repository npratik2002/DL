Parameter Tying and Parameter Sharing,
Parameter tying and parameter sharing are techniques used in neural networks to reduce the number of parameters and improve generalization. Here's an example in TensorFlow/Keras to illustrate parameter tying and parameter sharing using a simple convolutional neural network (CNN)
The shared_conv_layer is a convolutional layer shared between two branches of the network.
branch1 and branch2 share the convolutional layer but have their separate dense layers and output layers.
The model has two outputs (output1 and output2) with separate dense layers and output layers.
This architecture demonstrates parameter sharing because the same convolutional layer is used for processing inputs in both branches, and parameter tying because the weights of the shared convolutional layer are tied between the two branches.

You can customize this example based on your specific requirements and modify the architecture accordingly.
